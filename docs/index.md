# LuaEnglish
*An English to Lua programming language, transpiler, and plugin for Roblox.*

## Introduction & Purpose
*To be done. What should this language be for? What is the audience?c*

## What You Need To Know
This is in baby stages. Like a baby, this transpiler is stupid, and has a lot of work to be done before it actually is helpful. Helping me out by giving suggestions and bug reports is a huge deal for progressing the development of this resource.

> ⚠️ *Don't use this for full-production work yet! This is highly unstable and may not build/compile properly*
