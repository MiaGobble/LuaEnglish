# Lua English
*An English to Lua programming language, trans-piler, and plugin for Roblox.*

## Introduction & Purpose
It's as it sounds; this is a programming language that appears as almost grammatically correct English. You can access all Lua and Luau functionality, meaning the possibilities with this are endless!

When I first started programming, it was difficult to understand what certain terms meant. What's "setmetatable"? Why do I have to make syntax so specific? This is often an issue that resognates with aspiring programmers. I made this as a resource for people interested in programming to get started somewhere. This lets you get the hang of things while also having the ability to create a full-production game!

## What You Need To Know
This is in baby stages. Like a baby, this transpiler is stupid, and has a lot of work to be done before it actually is helpful. Helping me out by giving suggestions and bug reports is a huge deal for progressing the development of this resource.

> ⚠️ *Don't use this for full-production work yet! This is highly unstable and may not build/compile properly*

## Known Issues
This literally does not work yet lol. Will update this description upon announcement.
